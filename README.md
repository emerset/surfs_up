## Summary

Across the years analysed, June has a higher minimum, maximum, and average temperature than December does. There are enough data points in both June and December to validate the analysis as reliable.

This summary does not take into account precipitation, which is important if making a decision on which month is better to surf. In addition to looking at precipitation data, I would like to filter the data for time. I am not really interested in temperature data at midnight, I only care about dat time temperature, as I do not expect to be surfing at night.
